As part of the 2017 summer hackathon, i've built an analysis tool which could collect metrics from prometheus server, normalize data based on each feature (metric) and polish the data which could be fed into ML models for training.


For the purpose of the quick iteration and to double check the data aggregation works, have run once for the background and the other under stress which would allow us to see the change happening in the metrics. 

This would be re-visited as part of the future use in monitoring the system and gauging performance of Hub in different nodes.
